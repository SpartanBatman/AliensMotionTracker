# M314 Colonial Marine Motion tracker

## Credits

This project is based on the fantastic work by MartinR1000 who was the inspiration for me.

I've also used the Weyland-Yutani Logo created by Marrowbone. I liked how it worked with the tracker.

I've also remixed the 3D model from Thingiverse by DrMorbius
