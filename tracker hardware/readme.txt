This folder contains wiring diagrams for the components used in the tracker project. The components i used are as follows

1) an ILI9341 display of size 2.2in and resolution 240x320
2) a GY-271 digital compass (although i am evaluating the use of a tilt compensated compass module instead)
3) an Adafruit I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout - MAX98357A  
4) an Adafruit PowerBoost 500 Basic
5) a 4 ohm speaker 

(optional)

1) add a flashing LED to the motion tracker. This is to be housed in the display unit box as required. (see mt led.jpg)
   220ohm resistor attached to gpio 27. Led attached to resistor and 3v pin
